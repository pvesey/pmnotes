\section{Project Quality Management}

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Quality Management}
Project Quality Management Processes include all activities of the performing organisation that determine quality policy, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.\\
Processes are:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan Quality
	\item Perform Quality Assurance
	\item Perform Quality Control
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Quality Management}
PMBOK processes are intended to be compatible with International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) standards.\\
Other Standards include:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total Quality Management (TQM)
	\item Six Sigma
	\item Failure Mode \& Effect Analysis
	\item Etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Quality Management}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project Quality Management must address the management of projects and the product of the project.
	\item Project Quality Management applies to all projects regardless of the nature of the product.
	\item Project Quality Techniques are specific to the particular type of product produced by the project.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Quality Management}

Quality is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 'the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements', American Society for Quality, 2000
\end{itemize}
The critical element is to turn stakeholder needs, wants and expectations into requirements through Stakeholder Analysis, performed during Project Scope Management
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quality and Grade}
\textbf{Quality} and \textbf{Grade} are not the same.  \\
Grade is a category assigned to products or services having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. \\
\hspace{1cm} 5$\star$ Hotel\\
\hspace{1cm} 2$\star$ Hotel\\
Both serve the same function (provide a bed) but differ greatly technically.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Low Quality is always a problem
	\item Low Grade may not be a problem
\end{itemize}
Ryan Air: low grade (no frills), high quality.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Precision and Accuracy}
\textbf{Precision} and \textbf{Accuracy} are not the same.\\
Precision is consistency that the value of repeated measurements are clustered and have little scatter
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple Unit similarity
\end{itemize}
Accuracy is how `close' the measured value is to the real value
\begin{itemize}
	\item Measurement Error
\end{itemize}
Inaccurate measurement can yield false precision
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{QM and PM}
Quality Management and Project Management both recognize the importance of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Customer Satisfaction
	\item Prevention over Inspection
	\item Management Responsibility
	\item Continuous Improvement
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{Plan Quality}

\begin{frame}

\end{figure}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Plan Quality}
\textit{`Quality is Planned, Designed, and Built in - Not Inspected in.'}\\
Quality Planning involves identifying which quality standards are relevant to the project and determining how to satisfy them.\\
Quality Planning should be performed in parallel with all other planning processes\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item If high grade finished are required, then high grade resources (employees and/or subcontractors) need to be used in order to achieve the quality objective of `high grade finish'
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Plan Quality \hfill Inputs}
Enterprise Environmental Factors\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Government Rules, Standards, Regulations,
	\item Industry Best Practice etc.
\end{itemize}
Organisational Process Assets\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Performing Organisations Quality Policies, Procedures, Guidelines etc.
	\item If they do not exist, the PM team needs to generate them
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Plan Quality \hfill Inputs}
Scope Baseline\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Details Major Deliverables, Project Objectives, Thresholds, and Acceptance Criteria
	\item Thresholds: limits of cost, time, resources
	\item Acceptance Criteria: performance requirements and essential conditions that must be met before project deliverables are accepted
	\item Etc.
\end{itemize}
Refer to Book
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Plan Quality \hfill Tools and Techniques}
\textbf{Cost - Benefit Analysis (CBA)}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Remember Ford Pinto?  Cost of improved quality must be less than the potential savings or benefit
	\item Benefits can be realised by less Rework, Higher Productivity, increased stakeholder satisfaction (clients and employees)
\end{itemize}
	
\textbf{Benchmarking }

\begin{itemize}
	\item Comparing actual or planned projects practices to those of other projects to generate ideas for improvement and to provide a basis by which to measure performance: Dominos Pizza
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Domino's Pizza, and other similar organisations are a model for efficiency.  They can take an order, assemble and cook the product, and deliver it to your home within an hour.  Most organisations can only dream of this level of efficient production and logistics.  Recently, they have also been highly successful in implementing on-line order processing.  The Australian business unit is currently taking 50\% of their orders on-line, and expect this to grow to 80\% over the next 3 years.



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Plan Quality \hfill Tools and Techniques}
\textbf{Design of Experiments (DOE)}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Statistical Method that helps identify which factors may influence specific variables of a product or process under development.
	\item Also used for optimisation of processes
	\item Provides a framework that can be used to modify several important factors in parallel
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cost of Quality (COQ)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Total Costs incurred by investment in preventing non-conformance to requirements, appraising the product or service, etc.
	\item Failure Costs are often split into Internal Costs and External Costs
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Trends}
\textbf{Trend}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If there is a continued rise or fall in a series of points, this pattern is called a trend.
	\item In general, if 7 consecutive points rise or fall, there is an abnormality.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Periodicity}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Points that show the same pattern of change (rise or fall) over equal intervals
\end{itemize}
Hugging of the Centre Line
\begin{itemize}
	\item Points that are close to the central line, or to a control limit, are said to 'hug the line'
	\item Can be indicative of a process abnormality if there is a bias.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Pareto Diagram}
A Pareto Diagram is a specific type of histogram that is ordered by frequency of occurrence.
Organising the data in this way prioritizes the actions required to reduce non-conformance.
\begin{figure}

		\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{images/pareto.jpg}
	\label{fig:pareto}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Pareto Analysis}
There are 3 types of Pareto Analysis:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic
	\item Comparative
	\item Weighted
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Basic Pareto Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identifies the vital few contributors that account for most non-conformances
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Comparative Pareto Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Combines two or more Pareto Charts for the same process variable for comparison
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Weighted Pareto Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Applies a level of significance to other factors such as time, cost, and criticality.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Run Chart}
Trend Analysis is performed using Run Charts
\begin{figure}
	\centering

\end{figure}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Run Chart \& Trend Analysis}
Run Chart shows:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item History 
	\item Pattern of Variation
\end{itemize}
Run Charts show trends in processes over time.\\
Trend Analysis involves using mathematical techniques to forecast future outcomes based on historical results.\\
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Trend Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trend Analysis is a statistical method for determining the equation that best fits the data in a scatter plot or scatter diagram.
	\item Trend Analysis quantifies the relationships of the data, determines the equation and measures the fit of the equation to the data, e.g. Curve Fitting.
	\item One of the most important aspects of trend analysis is that it can be used for forecasting
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Scatter Diagram}
Scatter diagrams organise data using two variables
\begin{itemize}
	\item An input (or independent) variable
	\item An output (or dependant) variable
\end{itemize}
The relationship between variables fall into several categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Positive correlation (Student Performance'.)
	\item Negative correlation
	\item Curvilinear correlation
	\item No correlation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Statistical Sampling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Often it is impractical or impossible to inspect all incoming or outgoing materials or products.
	\item In these instances it is more practical to randomly select a smaller number of items and test for conformance.  This is known as \textbf{acceptance sampling}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the sample set passes, then the lot is accepted\\
		\item If the sample set fails, the entire lot is rejected\\
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Statistical Sampling}
\textbf{Common Sampling plans:}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Single Sampling - Lot is accepted or rejected based on one sampling run
	\item Double Sampling - A small sample size is tested.  If the results are not conclusive, a second sample is tested
	\item Multiple Sampling - Several small lots are sampled
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Sampling errors can occur:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item An acceptable lot can be rejected
	\item An unacceptable lot can be accepted
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Inspection}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inspection is the examination of a work product to determine whether it conforms to standards.
	\item Typically involves the selection and measurement of specific characteristics.
	\item For instance timber:
		\begin{itemize}	
			\item Type
			\item Size
			\item Warp
			\item Finish
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Measurements that are fed back into the Quality Assurance Process
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Validated Changes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Re-inspection after repair; results in either acceptance or rejection
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Validated Deliverables}
\begin{itemize}
