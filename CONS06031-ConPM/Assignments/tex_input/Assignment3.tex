\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment you are going to extract data from the project plan provided for the concrete structure shown in figure \ref{fig:building}.  The key deliverables for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Excel spreadsheet showing the cost build-up for the project 
	\item Excel line graph showing the cumulative cost build-up for the project 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Scenario}

You have been provided with a ProjectLibre file for the construction of the concrete structure shown in figure \ref{fig:building}.  The .pod file contains a simple Gantt chart and resource allocations.  Within the allocations you will also find quantities of concrete added for key features.\\

One objective of the assignment is to extract a cost profile for the construction of the structure at one week intervals.  This information is to be used to create a cost profile using Microsoft Excel.\\

Project Libre lacks some of the functionality that would make this assignment easier.  In order to overcome this shortfall in functionality, it will be necessary to save 'Baselines' within the project and use the 'Status Date' to assist in extracting the correct data.  The data you require can be read from the BCWS column of the Gantt Chart.  You should use the status dates as shown in the table below:


\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ |c|r| }
		\hline
		\textbf{No.} & \textbf{Status Date} \\
		\hline 
		1 & 29 Nov 2019 \\ 
		2 &  6 Dec 2019 \\ 
		3 & 13 Dec 2019\\ 
		4 & 20 Dec 2019\\ 
		5 & 27 Dec 2019\\ 
		6 &  3 Jan 2020\\ 
		7 & 10 Jan 2020\\ 
		8 & 17 Jan 2020\\ 
		9 & 24 Jan 2020\\ 
		10 & 31 Jan 2020\\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Your second objective is to show an 'Actual Cost' trace for costs incurred on the project up to the 13th of December 2019.  This will be achieved by setting an appropriate precentage completion on the individual activities and reading the data in the 'ACWP' column of the Gantt Chart.  In order to produce the trace, you will need to extract the cumulative ACWP data for 3 weeks.  You are free to overspend or underspend as you see fit in order to produce a suitable trace.
