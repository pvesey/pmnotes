\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment you are required to utilise Autodesk BIM360 for a number of tasks on a Model/Project that has been provided to you.  You should examine these documents in detail to gain an understanding of the project.\\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Document Management 
	\item Project Management
	\item Model Coordination
	\item Field Management
	\item Data Analytics
\end{enumerate}

You have been added to a BIM360 project entitled 'PM \& BIM Assignment 2 - 2020-2021'.  A screenshot of a portion of the model is shown in figure \ref{fig:thumbnail}.  BIM360 can be accessed at this link - \href{https://docs.b360.autodesk.com/}{docs.b360.autodesk.com/text}

\section*{Scenario}



This is a project for 4 individuals. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the project. As a team you are responsible for managing the workload and division of responsibility. All team members will receive the same mark, based on the academic merit of the complete submission.\\


In general, one Team member should implement an item or piece of functionality, while each of the remaining 3 team members either test or respond as appropriate.  Your report should detail how tasks were apportioned in an assignment matrix similar to the one shown in Table \ref{tab:AM}

\section{Document Management}

\begin{figure}[h!t]

	\label{fig:docmgmt}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Issue}

Create 4 valid issues on the any of the models/views in the project.  Each of these issues should be Created, Assigned, Actioned and Closed.  Document each of these issues in your report, including the Issue ID.

\subsection{Approval Workflow}

Create an Approval Workflow that involves 2 steps.  The fist step should be completed by two team members, and the second step by the other two team members.  Document the configuration settings in your report; an annotated screenshot is suitable for the report.  Name your Approval 'Team XX - Approval' 

\subsection{Transmittal}

Create a Transmittal for three documents from the project.  One team member should create the transmittal and the others should be the recipients.  Also include \href{mailto:paul.vesey@lit.ie}{paul.vesey@lit.ie} as a recipient.  Name your Transmittal 'Team XX - Transmittal'


\section{Project Management}

\end{figure}



\subsection{RFI Creation}
The default RFI Workflow will be used for this project.  Each team member should create an RFI, leading to 4 RFIs associated with the team.  All RFI's should be responded to in full by the other members.  Document each of these RFIs within your report. An annotated screenshot is suitable for the report. 


\section{Model Coordination}
\begin{figure}[h!t]

	\label{fig:modelmgmt}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Clash View}
Create one clash view for the team.  Document the details of this view in your report
\subsection{Clash Issue Creation}
Create 4 valid clash issues from the Clash View created in the previous sub-section.  Each of these issues should be Assigned, Actioned and Closed.  Document each of these issues in your report.


\section{Field Management}

\begin{figure}[h!t]
	\includegraphics[height=1.0cm]{RevitAssets/fieldmgmt}
	\label{fig:dieldmgmt}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Template Creation}

Each team member is to create a checklist template on a domain/discipline of their own choice.  The domains/disciplines must not be duplicated or overlapped, and therefore the team must coordinate their work.  Each template must contain at least 3 sections with 5 questions/tests in each section.  Document each template in your report.

\subsection{Checklist Creation}

Each team member is to complete 3 checklists for testing purposes.  The findings of these tests is to be fed back to the template creator for their comments or to make amendments.  These correspondences should be fully recorded and tracked using the Issue Tracking System in BIM360. These issues should have the 'Project Admin' category, and 'Checklist Testing' as root cause.  The creation/testing process is to be documented within your report.  



\section{Data Analytics - Insight}

\begin{figure}[h!t]
	\includegraphics[height=1.0cm]{RevitAssets/insight}
	\label{fig:insight}
\end{figure}




Create the following standard reports using BIM360 Insight: 

\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}  p{5cm} }
			\toprule
			\textbf{Main Section} & \textbf{Subsection} \\ 
			\cmidrule(r){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}
			Document Management & Issue Detail \\
			Project Management & RFI Detail \\
			Field Management & Checklist Detail \\
			Field Management & Issue Detail \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\label{tbl:markSchemeAsmt2}
	\end{center}
\end{table}


Each team member is responsible for creating one 'Insight' report.  All reports should be filtered so that only data 'assigned to' or 'created by' the team members is shown.  All reports should be run and exported as .pdf files.  These files are to be included in your report, along with a screenshot of the reports above as listed in BIM360.\\



\newpage
\section*{Report}
A single report of 4000 words should be submitted by each team.  Your report should be laid out in a professional manner, as would be done for a client or employer.  This involves, \emph{inter-alia}, a cover page, table of contents, and logical sectioning.  You report must include, but is not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Details of the methodology used to create each component
	\item Screen captures and images of system functionality
	\item Details of any challenges that you experienced with the application
	\item Commentary on learning experience and the skills you developed during the production of this assignment.
\end{itemize}
  


\section*{Submission}
The bulk of the deliverables will be created and delivered on Autodesk BIM360.  However, all computer files and the written report are to be zipped into a single file and uploaded to Microsoft Teams on or before the date and time indicated.  Key components of the submission are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item BIM360 work as described
	\item Report on the methodology used to meet the work requirements.  
\end{itemize}



\section*{Late Submission}
Failure to submit your assignment on or before the date and time indicated on Moodle will result in a penalty of 5\% per day or part thereof.
