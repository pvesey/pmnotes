\end{flushleft}

In this assignment you will manage the production of lecture notes for a normal class lecture.  The process will involve determining the content of the notes, delegating the content production to the class team, managing the production process, and assembling the final documentation.  Each class member will be assigned a lecture to manage.  All class members are expected to actively contribute to the work.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Trello (\href{trello.com}{trello.com}) will be used to manage the production process.
	\item The final notes are to take the form of a digital submission.  The exact format, .docx, .pptx, .pdf, etc. is at the managers discretion. 
	\item Final documentation will normally be submitted 3 weeks after the lecture is given.  A schedule of submission dates has been provided on Google Sheets at \href{https://goo.gl/L2KXkq}{https://goo.gl/L2KXkq}
	\item The final notes will be submitted via Moodle, and published on Moodle sometime after.
	\item 50\% of the mark awarded will be based on the teams evaluation of the manager.  Scoring criteria and methodology is detailed later in this document.
\end{itemize}
