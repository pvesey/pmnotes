\Large\textbf{Practical 1 - Microsoft Project / ProjectLibre}\\
\end{flushleft}


In this session we are going to create a simple project plan for a one-off house build using Microsoft Project.  The key objective of this assignment is to create a Gantt chart that can be used later for resourcing and costing.\\

Most students do not have access to Microsoft Project on their own machines.  A free alternative is ProjectLibre.  ProjectLibre can be obtained for free from \href{http://www.projectlibre.org/}{http://www.projectlibre.org/}.  I have also created an introductory video that can be viewed at \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSELiQqJETA}{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSELiQqJETA}.  ProjectLibre will satisfy most of the functionality requirements of these assignments.\\

Your project plan should include the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item All items should be automatically scheduled.
	\item All items, except the first, should have logical predecessors
	\item Predecessors should be used on grouped items where possible
	\item 
\end{itemize}
