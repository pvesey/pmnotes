\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management}


\begin{itemize}
\item Risk is a measure of the probability and consequence of not achieving a defined project goal.
\item Risk has two primary components
sub\item A probability of occurrence of that event
\item likelihood
sub\item Impact of the event occurring
\item How much will it cost?
\item Risk is a function of likelihood and impact
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


		

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management}

\begin{itemize}
\item Risk is, in effect, a lack of knowledge of future events
sub\item Future events that are favourable are called opportunities
sub\item Future events that are unfavourable are called risks
\item Another element of risk is its cause.
sub\item This can be something present or something missing
sub\item This is referred to as a ‘hazard’
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}







\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hazards
sub\item Certain hazards can be overcome by
\item Knowing what they are
\item Taking action to overcome them
\item So Risk is also a function of the hazard and the safeguard



\item Risk Increases with hazard and decreases with safeguard
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tolerance for Risk
sub\item Depends on individuals and/or organisations.
\item Some companies seek out risk, others avoid
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Project Risk Management
\item Risk Seeker
sub\item PM’s satisfaction increases at a greater rate as more money is at stake

\item Risk Averter
sub\item Utility rises at a decreasing rate.
\item As more money is at stake the project managers satisfaction diminishes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

Project Management
Year 4
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Because of the unique and temporary nature of projects, projects carry a greater level of risk than operations.

\item Risk may be defined as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has an effect on the project objectives.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\begin{itemize}
\item Managing project risk is an integral part of Project Management and critical to project success. 
\item Not managing project risk may result in:
sub\item Over Budget
sub\item Over Time
sub\item Poor Project Performance
sub\item Loss of reputation
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item RM includes the processes concerned with identifying, analysis and responding to uncertainty.
\item The purpose of risk management is to identify the risk factors for a project and then establish a risk management plan to minimize the probability & impact that the negative risk event will have on the project. 
\item The goal of risk management is to identify project risks and develop strategies, which either significantly reduce them or take steps to avoid them altogether.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item A Risk is a potential future problem that has not yet occurred 
sub\item A reactive project manager tries to resolve issues when they occur. 
sub\item A proactive project manager tries to resolve potential problems before they occur. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item No universal definition of the terms used. 
\item The scope and quality knowledge areas need review to see opportunities or threats. 
\item A single risk event may have multiple effects. 
\item Opportunities for one stakeholder may be a threat for another. 
\item Mathematical techniques used may create a false impression of precision and reliability.
\item Risk probability x Risk value (their product) is a typical risk quantification procedure. 
\item Responses include: contracting, bonding, contingency planning, insurance, alternative strategies. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item RM includes the processes concerned with identifying, analysis and responding to uncertainty. 
\item The key principle of Risk Management is to foresee problems before they occur and plan responses to them
\item Risk may be defined as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has an effect on the project objectives.
\end{itemize}

\item RESPONSE DEVELOPMENT: 
sub\item Avoid, transfer, mitigate, retain/accept, 
\item RESPONSE CONTROL: 
sub\item Execute plan in event 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk needs to be measured in terms of its potential impact or cost on the project, and the probability that the risk event will actually occur.  
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Qualitative Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item The overall risk measure against each risk is a combination of both of the probability that it will occur and the impact that the risk would have should it occur.  
\item Both the probability and impact are qualitative measures based on the team experience and technical knowledge. 
\item Risk Prioritisation
sub\item The risks analysed are prioritised for action
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Response}
	For each risk identified a Risk Response Strategy that should be considered.
\begin{itemize}
\item Choices are:
sub\item Risk Avoidance
sub\item Risk Transference
sub\item Risk Mitigation
sub\item Risk Acceptance
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Levels}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk occurs in different ways at every level of an organisation.
\item Risk may occur at the strategic level, programme level, project level and operational level.
\item Strategic Risk may be described as risk to the business strategy and is the concern and responsibility of the Management team.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Levels - Programme Risk}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risk at this level could be due to:
sub\item Interdependencies between projects
sub\item Overall resource levels
sub\item Changes in approved budget
sub\item Materials supply capability
sub\item The wider system -the political, economic, social, technological environment
\item These risks affect many projects simultaneously, and are managed by the Programme manager.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Levels sub\item Project & Operational}
\begin{itemize}
\item Project Risks:  
sub\item Risks at this level are threats to the success of a single project, and most often impact the principal targets of scope, time, cost, and quality, though may impact other knowledge areas at the same time. Risks that threaten the success of the project are the responsibility of the Project manager.
\item Operational Risk: 
sub\item The day-to-day operations are also subject to risks. Matters such as health and safety, industrial relations are amongst the operational risks faced by an organisation.
\item The identification of risks at different organisational levels allow identification of who has responsibility for the risk.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk and the Project Life Cycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project life cycle which establishes the phases through which a project will pass is so designed to enable the management of risk. 
\item The Knowledge areas also enable the effective management of projects. 
\item The process of risk management requires that risk be managed continuously throughout the life of the project.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Identification}
\begin{itemize}
\item The identification of risk should occur as early as possible –i.e. in the conception and definition phase. Risk identification requires an understanding of the project scope and objectives and deciding what may prevent the achievement of them.
\item The project charter will set out the high level risks to the project. It will also identify the success criteria by which the project will be judged later.
sub\item The potential risks to the project are identified as comprehensively as possible
sub\item Can be helpful to brainstorm in groups and draw on the experience of the project participants
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Identification}
\begin{itemize}
\item The feasibility study, if required, will identify and assess the risks in determining the best way of undertaking the project and to determine if proceeding with the project is the best option.
\item In the planning phase the project manager in the development of the project plan will evaluate the project risk and develop a risk response plan.
\item As part of implementation these plans will be executed. The process of risk identification and analysis should be re-applied through the implementation phase of the project to re-evaluate project risks
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Categories}
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical Risks
sub\item Robustness of the solution
sub\item Complexity of the system
sub\item Ownership
\item Business / Management Risk
sub\item Financing
sub\item Revenue / Cost / Margin
sub\item Shareholders
\item Delivery / Operational Risks
sub\item Training & Training Support
sub\item Human Resource Considerations
sub\item Complexity
sub\item Product Life Cycle
sub\item On going support
\item Cost
\item Schedule
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Recording and Scoring}
\begin{itemize}
\item A table for recording project risks is called a Risk Log. 
sub\item All identified risks must be recorded in the Risk Log. Risks with a significant potential impact may cause immediate alteration of the Project Plan, and therefore another iteration of risk identification is required

\item Risk Analysis
\begin{itemize}
sub\item Risk analysis involves assessing the probability of a risk occurring and its likely impact if it does occur. The ranking or scoring of risk involves the following calculation
\item Risk Ranking/Scoring = Probability x Impact
sub\item (High, medium , low)
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Qualitative Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Importance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider the relative impact each risk will have on the project if it happens. 
\item Note that low probability risks are often high on impact! 
\item Alternatively the Risk Probability/Impact Matrix maybe used to establish risk ranking by placing each risk in its correct box in the grid.
\item The distribution of risks over this matrix gives an overall view of the project risk level. 
sub\item Low-Medium-High
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Probability & Impact Matrix}
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Response}
\begin{itemize}
\item Once the risks are identified, analysed and prioritised, a plan of action to manage them is developed. 
\item There are 5 response types. (PMBOK gives 4) These are
sub\item Avoidance, 
sub\item Transfer, 
sub\item Reduction, 
sub\item Contingency  
sub\item Acceptance. 
\item If a risk has more than one response option, put multiple entries in the Risk Register
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Response}
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Response Selection}
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not dwell too long on the Response Type –it is more important to record the details of your risk mitigation.
\item Responses should be consistent with the project priorities. For example if the schedule is the top priority, try not to plan responses that will add time to schedule.
\item Make certain that the response you plan does not end up costing more time or money that the risk you are tying to cover. 
sub\item You may be better off with the problem than the solution
\item As you plan each response, identify who is responsible.
\item The same risk occurring at different times may require a different response. Note these as separate entries in the Risk Log.
\item Given your planned risk responses, reassess the probability and impact ratings for each risk. The aim is reduce each Risk Rating, and therefore the overall project risk.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Monitoring}
\begin{itemize}
\item Risks change over time. Having created the Risk Log during the Planning stage, these risks are monitored and controlled during the project execution. 
\item Update the Risk Log as old risks diminish and new risks appear. Reappraise the risk responses in the light of experience and progress. For a long project, this should be done at least monthly.
\item Sort the Risk Log in order of reducing rank. Review and monitor risks in order of priority
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Reporting}
\begin{itemize}
\item There may be examples of single, high-ranking project risks that have such a significant impact on the project; they need to be reported singly to the Programme Management Office as required. 
\item This would include risks that would:
sub\item Completely halt or unacceptably delay the project or
sub\item Cause over expenditure for the project,
sub\item Create a breech of legislation or law, such as Health & Safety Legislation etc.
sub\item Make the planned scope impossible to deliver
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision Trees}
\begin{itemize}
\item Decision trees are composed of nodes(circles, squares and triangles) and branches(lines).
\item The nodes represent points in time. A decision node(a square) is a time when the decision maker makes a decision. A probability node(a circle) is a time when the result of an uncertain event becomes known. An end node(a triangle) indicates that the problem is completed -all decisions have been made, all uncertainty have been resolved and all payoffs have been incurred.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}







\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision Trees}
\begin{itemize}
\item Time proceeds from left to right. This means that branches leading into a node (from the left) have already occurred. Any branches leading out of a node (to the right) have not yet occurred.
\item Branches leading out of a decision node represent the possible decisions; the decision maker can choose the preferred branch. Branches leading out of probability nodes represent the possible outcomes of uncertain events; the decision maker has no control over which of these will occur.
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision Trees
\item Probabilities are listed on probability branches. These probabilities are conditional on the events that have already been observed (those to the left). Also, the probabilities on branches leading out of any particular probability node must sum to 1.
\item Individual monetary values are shown on the branches where they occur, and cumulative monetary values are shown to the right of the end nodes. (Two values are often found to the right of each node: the top one is the probability of getting to that end node, and the bottom one is the associated monetary value).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}









\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Decision Making}
Decision Making Processes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item collect information
\item establish root cause
\item generate solutions
\item select best option
\item implement/monitor

\frametitle{Tree Construction}

\item Identify the decision points and alternatives actions available at each point
\item Identify the uncertainties
\item Estimate quantitative information (costs of possible outcomes, gains resulting from outcomes, probabilities of chance events)
\item Define criteria of desirability
\item Evaluate tree
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Key Points}
	Decision trees provide an effective method of Decision Making because they:
\begin{itemize}
sub\item Clearly lay out the problem so that all options can be challenged 
sub\item Allow us to analyze fully the possible consequences of a decision 
sub\item Provide a framework to quantify the values of outcomes and the probabilities of achieving them 
sub\item Help us to make the best decisions on the basis of existing information and best guesses. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}







\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Need for Care}
\begin{itemize}
\item  As with all Decision Making methods, decision tree analysis should be used in conjunction with common sense - decision trees are just one important part of your Decision Making tool kit.

Selection of Alternatives
\begin{itemize}
\item A new hospital facility can be constructed to meet current and future patient projections over the next 20 years, or in two stages, one now and the next ‘n’ years from now
sub\item Construction Costs
\item Full Capacity Construction	€140M
\item Two Stage: 1st Stage		€100M

\item B, cost of occurrence: €5,000; probability of occurrence 0.35 
\item C, cost of occurrence: €6,500; probability of occurrence 0.15 
\item D, cost of occurrence: €2,000; probability of occurrence 0.40 
\item E, cost of occurrence: €4,000; probability of occurrence 0.35
