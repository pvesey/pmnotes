This is an individual project.  You are encouraged to discuss your project with your peers, however all work submitted must be your own, with attribution where appropriate.\\

In this assignment you are required to create a detailed project plan for a construction project of your choice.  The project plan should include the traditional project management documents as well as a Post Contract Award BIM Execution Plan.  You are free to use the documentation pack used for Assignment 2.\\

The key deliverables for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Detailed Project Management Plan 
	\item Post Contract BIM Execution Plan
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Scenario}

Select a project with which you are familiar. The project must be a construction related project where BIM was or could be deployed.  The project must have at least 20 tasks and a maximum of 30, excluding heading items.\\

Develop the following items as detailed below. Descriptions of items 1 to 10 are available in the lecture notes, and are based on PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge\\

You are advised to use the RIAI Template for Item 11, the Post Contract BIM Execution Plan, available on OneNote.\\

The objective of this assignment is to produce a comprehensive project plan. The text of the document should clearly show how the various aspects of the project are going to be managed and controlled. You are encouraged to use appropriate standard templates and methodologies.  Standard Templates and Methodologies should be correctly attributed.\\

Your final document should be of professional standard in terms of content, layout and completeness. In essence, the completed document should be suitable for presentation to a prospective client.\\

The Reflective Statement should detail your learning experience while undertaking this coursework and your opinion on its relevance to the subject, etc.\\

You are encouraged to use Microsoft Project, Autodesk Revit, Autodesk Construction Cloud and other applications as appropriate.\\

This is a practical assignment. Your project management document should fully based on the practical implementation of project management theory.\\

\subsection*{Project Scope Statement}
Your project scope statement should clearly describe your project and the key deliverables and constraints.  You are advised to examine various templates and generate your scope statement based on your research. 
\subsection*{Work Breakdown Structure}
You may use Microsoft Project to create your work breakdown structure. You should have a maximum of 30 items, excluding items used for headings and groupings.  Items of work that are subcontracted do not have to be developed further down the WBS.
\subsection*{Resource Breakdown Structure}
You are may select and use the most appropriate RBS structure for your project.  The structure does not need to be developed below subcontractor level.
\subsection*{RACI Responsibility Assignment Matrix}
Your RACI matrix must be aligned with your WBS and RBS.  The use of Excel is advised for this section of the assignment. 
\subsection*{Network Diagram, Gantt Charts and PERT Analysis}
Your WBS should form the basis for your Gantt Chart and Network Diagram.  Both of these elements must be generated in Microsoft Project.  The PERT analysis should be carried out in Excel, using the Critical Activities and Critical Path generated in Microsoft Project.  You will have to generate appropriate values for T$_{p}$ and T$_{o}$ in order to conduct this analysis.  Your report should include all calculations and workings, and show completion dates with 50\%, 85\% and 95\% probability.     


\subsection*{Risk Management Plan}
Your Risk Management Plan should document the Risk Management processes that you are putting in place for this project.  The Risk Register should show the risks identified and the measures taken to manage these risks.  The timing of the risk events should coincide with the schedule for the project.


\subsection*{Cost Management Plan}
Your Cost Management Plan should present a high level overview of the costs projections for the project, including the total overall value of the project, the proportion of the contract allocated to the main contractor and the value of subcontracted elements.  A time-based cost profile of the project should be included along with forecast modelling to determine the value and time of peak-debt.  You are also tasked with creating an three EVM tables for the project at key points in the project execution.  You will have to estimate your own percentage completion data based to complete this task.  Key items to be included in the report include EV, PV, \% complete, CPI, SPI, EAC and ETC for each time point.

\subsection*{Communications Plan}
	- Identified Stakeholders
	- Information Distribution Plan
	- Performance Report Requirements
\subsection*{Human Resource Plan}
	- Project Team Acquisition Plan 
	- Release Criteria 
\subsection*{Procurement Management Plan} 
	- Seller Selection Procedure 
	- Identify 3 vital project elements that need to be sourced from outside the organisation.  Allocate contract types to each of these.
\subsection*{Post Contract BIM Execution Plan}
\subsection*{Reflective Statement} 

There are numerous reflective practice frameworks in common use.  The diagram below depicts the Gibbs Reflective Cycle.  You are free to use any methodology.
