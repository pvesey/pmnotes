\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Develop HR Plan}
HR Planning determines:
\begin{itemize}	
	\item Project Roles
	\item Responsibilities
	\item Reporting Relationships
	\item Staffing Management Plan
\end{itemize}
Project Roles can be for persons or groups\\
Staffing Management Plan typically details when resources will be required and where they will come from - Staff, Contract, Subcontractor, etc.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{RBS and Project Management Software}
\begin{itemize}
	\item More sophisticated PM Software, such as Primavera and MS Project Server will include RBS functionality.
	\item Note that Standard MS Project does not include RBS functionality
\end{itemize}

Databases allow greater information to be stored:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skills
	\item Availability
	\item Location

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Matrix Charts}
\textbf{RACI Responsibility Assignment Matrix}
\begin{itemize}

	\item Accountable - To whom `R' is Accountable
	\item Consult - Has capability and/or information necessary to perform the work
	\item Inform - Must be notified of results, but does not need to be consulted
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 6cm]{images/Fig9-5.jpg}
	\label{fig:9-5b}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}\begin{center}\line(1,0){250}\end{center}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{}
\textbf{Typical Process to Generate an RACI Chart:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Identify all of the activities involved in the project (WBS!)
	\item Identify all roles necessary to complete the project.
	\item Identify who will satisfy R, A, C, I for each task
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In general only one person or group should be assigned as `Responsible'
		\end{itemize}
	\item Resolve overlaps and gaps
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Overlap; more than one R
			\item Gap; no R, no A, etc.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}	
\end{frame}\begin{center}\line(1,0){250}\end{center}
 
 
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Develop HR Plan \hfill Tools and Techniques}
\textbf{Organisation Charts and Position Descriptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Text Orientated Formats
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Usually an outline form.
				\item Provides information such as responsibility, authority, competencies, and qualifications.
				\item Good for capturing lessons learned information.
				\item Networking
			\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Organisation Theory}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Information regarding the ways people, teams and organisational units behave such as the Hawthorne Studies, Maslow, Theory X-Theory Y, etc.
		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}\begin{center}\line(1,0){250}\end{center}
 
The Hawthorn Effect or Observer Effect are terms used to describe how people will modify their behavior when being observed.  The Hawthorn Studies were commissioned by Western Electric of Chicago between 1924 and 1932.  One of the objectives of the study was to determine how light levels effected worker performance.  A simple hypothesis was formed: more light, better work.  However, when conducting the studies it was found that the opposite occurred.  As light levels dropped, performance improved. This remained until a point was reached where performance cratered.  Later, it was determined that the results observed were attributable workers reacting to being watched and questioned about their work. \\

Another interesting phenomenon is the the Pygmalion or Rosenthal Effect, whereby the greater the expectation, the greater a person will perform.  The opposite effect is the golem effect whereby low expectations generally yield low performance.

\begin{block}{Responsibility and Authority are not the same thing}
Individuals will perform best when they responsibility and authority are matched.
\end{block}
Responsibility / Authority miss-match is very common.  How many times have you experienced either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Someone's decision/instructions being reversed or changed? 
	\item Someone having to constantly respond with `I need approval from X before I can give you the go-ahead'

		\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\textbf{Training Needs:}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  	What training staff will be required to undertake
		\end{itemize}

\textbf{Project Manager pitfalls}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lack of self-knowledge, ie, your own strengths and weaknesses
	\item Activity traps\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  `Means becomes the end' rather than `the means to achieve the end'
		\end{itemize}
	\item Managing versus doing\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Delegating work instead of doing it yourself
		\end{itemize}
	\item	People versus task skills\\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item  Do you use people you get along with in preference to those who can do the task?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Ineffective communications\\
	\item Time Management\\
	\item Management bottlenecks\\
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}\begin{center}\line(1,0){250}\end{center}

Activity Traps are very problematic; it is the illusion of working on something whilst not actually making any real progress.  Consider a research paper.  The deliverable is a high quality research paper.  In order to meet this deliverable, a considerable amount of reading is required.  If you never get out of the reading/analyzing stage, you will never achieve the deliverable.  Often we see evidence of this in individuals who seem to be constantly working, display clear evidence of a broad level of knowledge, but struggle to turn in quality work.\\

Managers are often quite proficient at the work their subordinates do.  This can occasionally lead to difficulties were managers begin to micro-manage subordinates and/or take on their work entirely.  A good manager will help if they can, guide as opposed to instruct, but most of all, allow subordinates to make mistakes; and then correct them.

A good compromise leaves everybody mad.  It is useful to know that there are times when resolution of the conflict is not the goal of all parties.  A typical dispute management clause in a contract involves steady escalation; i.e. Conciliation, then Arbitration.  One party may enter conciliation wanting to put the issue in front of an arbitrator.  Why you may ask?  There are cases where the outcome from one project will have an impact on a similar project not under dispute.  As the arbitration judgment is made by an independent third party it is a good indication of how a similar dispute will be handled on another project.  Historically, there was a third stage; the High Court.  Attempts to overturn arbitrators decisions are rare in the High Court now since Limerick City Council v Uniform Construction Limited [2005] IEHC 347. A recent attempt by Dunnes Stores also failed\\
